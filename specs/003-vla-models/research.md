# Research: Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Decision: Content Focus on VLA Models and LLM-Robotics Convergence

**Rationale**:
The feature specification for Module 4 is to educate learners on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and the convergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with robotics. This module will cover key technologies such as OpenAI Whisper for speech recognition, LLMs for cognitive planning, and the translation of natural language into ROS 2 actions. The research confirms these are critical, cutting-edge topics in Physical AI. The content will focus on explaining these concepts, their practical applications, and architectural considerations.

**Key Technologies to Explain**:
- **VLA (Vision-Language-Action) Models**: The paradigm of integrating visual perception, natural language understanding, and robot action.
- **OpenAI Whisper**: A general-purpose speech recognition model for transcribing audio into text.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Such as GPT, for cognitive planning, natural language understanding, and generating action sequences.
- **ROS 2 Actions**: As a mechanism for executing long-running robot tasks.
- **End-to-End System Architecture**: How these components integrate in a robotic system.

**No External Dependencies or Complex Integrations (for Docusaurus)**:
The content delivery itself will utilize Docusaurus, as established in previous modules. There are no new external dependencies or complex integrations required for the Docusaurus site itself for this module. The technical requirements are about explaining the *subject matter* clearly within the markdown files, potentially including code snippets for demonstration.
