# Research: Module 3 - NVIDIA Isaac Platform

## Decision: Content Focus on NVIDIA Isaac Ecosystem

**Rationale**:
The feature specification for Module 3 is to educate learners on the NVIDIA Isaac Platform, including Isaac Sim for simulation, Isaac ROS for hardware acceleration, and concepts like VSLAM and Nav2 path planning. The research confirms that these are distinct, yet interconnected components within NVIDIA's robotics ecosystem. The content will focus on explaining these concepts and their practical application.

**Key Technologies to Explain**:
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: A scalable robotics simulation application and synthetic data generation tool.
- **NVIDIA Isaac ROS**: A collection of hardware-accelerated ROS 2 packages that make it easier for developers to build high-performance AI-powered robots.
- **VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: A fundamental robotics task for which Isaac ROS provides accelerated solutions.
- **Nav2**: The ROS 2 navigation stack, which can be leveraged within the Isaac platform for robot path planning.

**No External Dependencies or Complex Integrations (for Docusaurus)**:
The content delivery itself will utilize Docusaurus, as established in Module 1. There are no new external dependencies or complex integrations required for the Docusaurus site itself for this module. The technical requirements are about explaining the *subject matter* clearly within the markdown files.
